# A Basic Struts2, Guice and Freemarker Web Application

The aim of this web application is to provide a _basic_ example of a web application which combines
**Struts2, Google Guice and Apache Freemarker**. It is **NOT** intended to be an example of _best practice_,
rather _a way of wiring things together_. Some of the Java is coded for readability. There are no unit tests.

It is assumed that the developer knows how to deploy the web application to a web container.

## Components

1. Struts2 (2.5.20)
2. Google Guice (4.2.2)
3. Freemarker (as shipped with Struts2 above)
